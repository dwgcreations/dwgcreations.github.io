<h2 style="color: #2e6c80; text-align: center;">An explanation on why Brave Tokens, and essentially, the browser itself is a waste of time:</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">One of the new forms of cryptocurrency known as Basic Attention Token (BAT) has been widely discussed around the crypto-community. This new form of token which is based on attention (hence the name (Basic Attention Token) relies on the user being active and attentive (currently based on physical mouse movement). It shows ads through Windows Notifications, but are those ads worth it?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Currently I've been running the browser for over a month and I've made just shy of $3 USD worth of BAT. That's like, basically picking up aluminum cans off the side of the road money, in exchange for you being attentive and using the browser over the others (firefox, or an ungoogled chromium build). It really just does not end up being worth it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The way that they control their sub reddit is also very ham-fisted. They usually do not respond to users attacking one another unless its reported, and I can see the whole community becoming a cesspool.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Is BAT the future? I think not! Discuss it in retweets or on the sub reddit&nbsp;<a href="SubReddit%20for Brave Browser">https://bit.ly/2TZZ6Fg</a></p>
