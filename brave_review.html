<h1 style="color: #5e9ca0; text-align: center;">Why is it important to avoid Brave Browser?</h1>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80; text-align: center;">An explanation on why Brave Tokens, and essentially, the browser itself is a waste of time:</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">One of the new forms of cryptocurrency known as Basic Attention Token (BAT) has been widely discussed around the crypto-community. This new form of token which is based on attention (hence the name (Basic Attention Token) relies on the user being active and attentive (currently based on physical mouse movement). It shows ads through Windows Notifications, but are those ads worth it?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">No.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The way that they control their sub reddit is also very ham-fisted. They control the tokens and their worth , therefore there is no market for it in the future. I feel sorry for the advertisers who are currently in grips with BAT.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This message has been AD sponsered by NO ONE. Hence: there are NO ADS of any sort. Kinda strange to see such a thing in this day and time right? Let's reclaim the internet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Use ungoogled chromium instead of brave browser.&nbsp;</p>
