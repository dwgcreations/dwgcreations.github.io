<p style="text-align: center;">One of the new forms of cryptocurrency known as Basic Attention Token (BAT) has been widely discussed around the crypto-community. This new form of token which is based on attention (hence the name (Basic Attention Token) relies on the user being active and attentive (currently based on physical mouse movement).

<p style="text-align: center;">No.&nbsp;</p>
